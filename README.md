# cyclone

Cyclone downloads and installs my prefered configurations for bash, vim, and git. 
As well as downloads and installs tools I deam usefull. I strive to make the my 
work accessable to those who wish to customise. I will warn you however I do have
a bit of OCD and do some unnessary things to keep the script looking clean and neat.

###### Note: Debian based distros only
Do not support Fedora or any other yum/dnf based package mamagers. May someday add 
support for those distros.

###### Note: Mac OS X 
Mac OS X does have a little bit of support mostly vim and git. 

###### Note: Windows
Windows has a very basic Power Shell config to get rid of that blue backgroung and
give a more plesent Unix like shell. Future tools like Python and Git are in the
making.
