There are several things I would like to do with this new version.

1) Add windows powershell 
    a. Add a powershell script to set up my windows dev environment.
       Will need to include:
            1. powershell config
            2. bds tools refer to mac/Downloads/Agent_Essential
            3. research other cool tools and tricks for windows

2) Configure tools
    a. Base work is done now configure all the tools. Those installed
       with apt-get are done. All that are installed with git and curl
       need to be installed and configured.
            1. Git
            2. Curl
